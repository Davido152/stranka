            <h1>What defines me</h1>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                Probably the most important part of my life. Without it, I don't know where 
                I'd be now. Started about seven years ago, and enjoy it more and more by the day, 
                with a strong desire to keep progressing.
                <br>
                List of instruments I play:

                    <li>Table/My legs/Well, anything that can be hit (falls under the drums cathegory)</li>
                    <li>And I can blow into a saxophone (harder than it seems)</li>

            <p>
                I've been playing drums the longest, for about seven years now (I don't keep exact track). 
                It's my main instrument. Two years after starting drums, I began learning bass, and even 
                though I don't prioritize it as much, I sometimes play it even more. I'm actually in two bands 
                as a bassist. 
                I've learned some guitar and piano because i sometimes play then for fun whenever they're just lying around. 
                As for the other instruments, I learned them because of music school (where percussionists are often needed).
            </p>

            <h3>Other (less significant) things</h3>
            <p>
                Apart from music there isn't that much to mention since it takes up most of my free time.
                However, I'm also a bit interested in computers in the broader sense
                that I can wrap my head around them and I am pretty knowledgeable in this area.
                I've also started a few projects that I never finished because I couldn't be bothered. (had more important stuff to do)
                (for example <a

                or <a
                    href="https://github.com/Davido152/Minecraft-Survival-Ascended">this one</a>,
                or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of
                    Code</a>).

            <h1>Where do I see myself in the future</h1>
            <p>
                Writing this in My Interests section since, for about a year now, I've been very interested in aviation
                and my dream is to become a pilot one day. So yeah, hope it works out and till then, I'll be preparing
                for what awaits me on my path there.
