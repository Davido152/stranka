            <h1>Who am I</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Dávid Mrúz, I'm 16 years old, and as many of you already know (because someone always has something to say about it),
                I live in Radatice.
            </p>

            <h1>My wonderful personality</h1>
            <p>
                This was probably the hardest part of making this page. Maybe because I don't really like to talk about myself since I feel there isn't much 
                to say about me.
                Anyways, from those things I am able to say there is for example the fact that I try to take things as they come
                and not let unnecessary things bother me, oh and also I'm up for any silliness.
                Another thing to mention, which may be quite a good one, or maybe not, well, depends on the situation,
                is that I try to perfect the things that interest me to the smallest details but on the other hand,
                when something doesn't interest me that much, I can't be bothered to waste my time on it.
                Regarding my relationship with people, I enjoy company, but sometimes I also need 
                some time for myself to recharge my social battery. 
                Additionally, I think I can very well adapt to new knowledge and experiences,
                make logical connections, and have a great orientation in space.
                I hope these skills will help me in my future, which I've 
                described a bit more in the section about my interests.
